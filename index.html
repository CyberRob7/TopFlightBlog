                <h3>Cloud Engineering 101: Building the Foundation for Modern Applications</h3>
                <h4>Engineering | Security | Compliance | Computing | Management</h4>
                <p>In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, cloud computing has become the backbone of modern applications. Cloud engineering, the discipline of designing, deploying, and managing cloud-based systems, plays a crucial role in enabling organizations to harness the power of the cloud. This blog post aims to provide an introductory overview of cloud engineering, its key concepts, and its significance in the world of software development. To start, we should answer the question, what is cloud engineering? Cloud engineering refers to the practice of designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure, applications, and services that operate in the cloud computing environment. It involves a combination of skills, knowledge, and expertise in areas such as cloud architecture, cloud deployment models, automation, scalability, security, and performance optimization. Cloud engineering focuses on leveraging cloud computing technologies and platforms to create robust and scalable solutions that meet the needs of businesses and organizations. It involves understanding the capabilities and features of different cloud service providers (such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform) and selecting the most appropriate services to meet specific requirements. With that, we can obtain a general overview of the practice of cloud engineering with more to be explored in future illustrations.
